# 4S

Super-Safe, Small, and Simple (4S) Reactor is a sodium fast reactor developed by Toshiba, Japan. It is composed of reactor core in the shape of hexagonal lattice, one central reactivity control system, sodium coolant, and reflector. This is a modeling and simulation of 4S reactor using MCNPX to determine the full-core criticality, reactivity values, and fuel temperature reactivity coefficient (Doppler coefficient).
